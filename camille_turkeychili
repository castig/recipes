Ingredients:
1-2 medium zucchinis
2-3 yellow onions
2-3 medium carrots
3 cans of diced tomatoes
1 can of green beans
Pinto, black, and garbanzo beans (1 can of each and 1 more can of your preference)
1 cup veggie/chicken stock
Quarter of a Lime
1 teaspoon Brown Sugar
1-2 lbs Ground Turkey
Salt
Swiss Chard/collard greens
Olive oil
1 tablespoon Cumin
1 tablespoon Coriander
1 tablespoon (or a little more) Chili powder

Instructions:
Chop vegetables into approximately bean-sized pieces so it all cooks evenly (but dice onions and cut carrots on the smaller side since they take much longer to cook).
In a large pot, saut√©e onions and spices in a little olive oil (5 min), then add the carrots (10 min).
Add in tomatoes, 1 cup of chicken stock, a little water, and the beans (cover with lid).
Separately, make rice and cook ground turkey.
Heat frying pan until warm enough to brown meat. Sprinkle salt on the pan (enough to cover the surface).
Place small, flattened turkey patties in the pan until starting to brown. Flip over and re-salt the pan.
Check patties by cutting in half. Remove patties when done and re-salt the pan (it's ok if the patties aren't completely cooked as they will cook more in the chili).
Repeat until finished with all the turkey.
Heat for 30 min until it starts to boil a little (heat with the lid on). About halfway through this, add the zucchini, string beans, and ground turkey (break the turkey patties up into smaller pieces before adding).
Add the Swiss chard and cook for 45+ more min. Start with the lid on to steam the Swiss chard, but remove the lid after 15-20 minutes if the chili needs to be thickened. Cook until it reaches desired thickness.
Add juice from a quarter of a lime and 1 teaspoon of brown sugar in this last phase of cooking.
Season to taste with salt, though it often doesn't need any extra since the ground turkey is cooked in salt and usually provides enough for the chili.
