Cut your chicken in big parts (one cleaned of course)

Mix with 3 or 4 large onions, 5 or 6 juicy limes, 2 spoonfuls of oil, Salt, pepper  
(for  better, spicy  taste add hot pepper e.g jalapeno or Senegalese scotch bonnet )

Add one small red sweet pepper cut into dice

Add a big spoon of  French Dijon Mustard (not the sweet American mustard)

Mix well all the ingredients together and let it marinate for 2 or 3 hours, Overnight is even better.

When you are ready to cook

Separate the chicken from the rest  (clean it from onions, sweet peppers and lime sauce)

Put chicken on the grill until golden (well cooked,)

While chicken on the grill: Put  2 spoons of oil and cook  the onions (extract the sauce) until they turn dark brown

Add the grilled chicken and the sauce.

You can add Â¼ cup of water and let it simmer until the sauce gets thicker.
