WHAT INGREDIENTS DO YOU NEED FOR HOMEMADE SALSA?
Onion and Garlic – You’ll give the onions and garlic a quick coarse chop and then your food processor will do the rest.
Jalapeño – Most of the heat in a jalapeno is in the seeds and ribs. I recommend removing the seeds and ribs or the heat could overwhelm the other flavors in your salsa. I use half a jalapeño in this salsa recipe.
Tomatoes – I recommend using canned fire roasted diced tomatoes as well as a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (for spice). You can use regular canned diced tomatoes, but the fire roasted tomatoes will give your salsa a rich, roasted tomato flavor. It is so good!
Sugar – Just a small pinch of sugar will balance out the acidity of the tomatoes.
Salt – Salt will bring out the flavors of the other ingredients in your salsa.
Cumin – Ground cumin adds a subtle smoky flavor.
Cilantro – You can adjust the amount of fresh cilantro to your tastes. I believe cilantro is essential to a good salsa, but if you don’t enjoy the flavor, leave it out.
Lime Juice – Start with a small squeeze of fresh lime juice. You can always add more.
